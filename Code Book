This repo contains an R script called 'run_analysis.R', in which the following tasks are performed.

#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set#

-First, this script allows you to download and decompress the necessary data to generate the "UCI HAR DATASET" folder.
-Second, once the folder has been decompressed, we call all the bases and merge them into an ordered base

#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

-Third, using the dplyr package, we only select the variables that contain "mean" and "std"

#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

-Fourth, we use the second column of the base called "activities_labels" to make a description of the activities of the ordered base "Tidy"

#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

- fifth, change the descprición of each variable, eliminating its avrebiación and using labels more accurate

#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

-Finally, with the dplyr package we create a table with the required specifications. We store this package in a separate file .txt format
