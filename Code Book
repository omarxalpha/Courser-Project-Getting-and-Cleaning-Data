This repo contains an R script called 'run_analysis.R', in which the following tasks are performed.

#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set#

-First, this script allows you to download and decompress the necessary data to generate the "UCI HAR DATASET" folder.
-Second, once the folder has been decompressed, we call all the bases and merge them into an ordered base

features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns 
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns 
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column 
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns 
contains recorded features test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns 
contains test data of activities’code labels
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column 
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns 
contains recorded features train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns 
contains train data of activities’code labels

orderer base Tidy (10299 rows, 563 column)

#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

-Third, using the dplyr package, we only select the variables that contain "mean" and "std"

#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

-Fourth, we use the second column of the base called "activities_labels" to make a description of the activities of the ordered base "Tidy"

#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

- fifth, change the descprición of each variable, eliminating its avrebiación and using labels more accurate

#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

-Finally, with the dplyr package we create a table with the required specifications. We store this package in a separate file .txt format
